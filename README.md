# WindowHijack
Rendering on a window that isn't yours.

### Description
I was inspired by [this post](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/anti-cheat-bypass/263403-window-hijacking-dont-overlay-betray.html) on an online forum, talking about using an application as an overlay and drawing on it using simple techniques. I saw that the source code was kind of sloppy and inefficient so I remade it to be digestable by every day programmers. Similar to my DLLInjector don't think it will helpful for bypassing any modern anti-viruses or anti-cheats so I'm completely comfortable sharing this with the world. I would love to see how people will puts this to use.
